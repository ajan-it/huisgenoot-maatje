-- Keep SECURITY DEFINER only for functions that truly need elevated privileges
-- and remove it from others that can rely on RLS

-- The is_household_member function needs SECURITY DEFINER because it's used in RLS policies
-- Keep it as is

-- The trigger functions need SECURITY DEFINER to work properly
-- Keep add_owner_membership, set_household_created_by, update_updated_at_column as is

-- The RPC functions for household operations should keep SECURITY DEFINER 
-- because they perform complex operations that need to bypass RLS temporarily
-- but with proper auth checks
-- Keep rpc_create_household, rpc_upsert_household_tasks, rpc_remove_task_from_plan as is

-- Remove SECURITY DEFINER from other functions that don't need it
-- These functions already removed in previous migration:
-- - get_occurrence_status_labels (utility function)
-- - check_boost_needed (can rely on RLS)
-- - log_boost_interaction (can rely on RLS)

-- This migration is just a comment to document the security analysis
-- All necessary changes were made in the previous migration
